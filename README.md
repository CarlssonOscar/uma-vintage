# UX 
The design of the website has been a collaboration with the author and the storeowners ideas for how the store should look. The minimalist design has it's limitations in terms of UX since it can come of as unclear. I'm aware that the lack of langueage could be a cause for concern since how to use the site can vauge to some people. But since it was pretty much a requirement from the client to keep language to a minimum I've tried to use as familiar symbols a possible to minimize confusion.

On the first page on is greeted with a spinning company logo. The Logo is based on a LP shape, the choice to rotate it for this reason probably is obvious. The first idea was to spin the LP in the same pace as it normally would, which is 33 roations a minute. Unfortunatly this made it possible to read what is written on the logo so a slower rotation speed was settled on.

The goal with the different parts of the site has been to keep them as similar as possible. 
The sites main color is white with black text, symbols and buttons. The choice to use white is in part a decision made with the intention to keep the content in focus. Another aspect is that the author is not famililar with many photos direction tools, the index page rotating photo has a white background.

The footer is despite it's languge very similar to the header in terms on design, the letters are bold and the Facebook logo is a familiar symbol to most people.
